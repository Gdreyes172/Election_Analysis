## Based on the results Jefferson and Arapahoe county did not have even half of their voter turnout. It can be assumed that most of the candidates efforts were focused solely on Denver county. Simple cross multiplication can give a glimpse of how many votes were left over in Jefferson county and Arapahoe county. Jefferson came in with about 10% of their votes at 38,855. Simple algebra would provide us with the other 90%, whic is about 388,000 voters who didn't participate in the election. Arapahoe county had 93.3% of their voter not show up to the polls which appear to be about 345,000 votes that were missed out on.

# Summary:
## Unsure of the reason for only focusing on Denver county, but there was a clear gap in voter turnout in Jefferson and Arapahoe county. Either of the other two candidates could have stole the race, or at least made it less of a land-slide victory by appealing to voters in other counties. That said, Diana DeGette did really well to have secured her victory.
